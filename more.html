    <h1>About the books</h1>
    <p>NotQuiteTher has about 15k titles in its database, comprising about a quarter of the Project Gutenberg library. The abridgment is to save memory. Titles were included (and excluded) at random, save that the 79 most-popular titles were all included, and more popular books were generally more likely to be included than less popular books. A small percentage of titles were excluded for text-format/UTF-8 incompatibility. No consideration was made for content.</p>
    <p>The books that a player ultimately sees during game-play are picked at random from one of six categories. These are the six categories, along with the number of books in each:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>+5k downloads/month (79 books)</li>
        <li>+1k downloads/month (426 books)</li>
        <li>+100 downloads/month (5050 books)</li>
        <li>-5 downloads/month (7294 books)</li>
        <li>uploaded in 2021 (2799 books)</li>
        <li>uploaded in 2022 (441 books)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The player can switch from one category to another during game-play. The default category is +5k dls/mo. Note that download numbers aren't current. See Project Gutenberg for up-to-date stats. NotQuiteTher categories are based on data from a 30-day period ending in March 2022. These were the top 10 titles:</p>
    <ol class="top_titles">
        <li>"Frankenstein" by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley</li>
        <li>"Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen</li>
        <li>"Alice in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll</li>
        <li>"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" by Arthur Conan Doyle</li>
        <li>"Simple Sabotage Field Manual" by the U.S. Office of Strategic Services</li>
        <li>"The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald</li>
        <li>"The Scarlet Letter" by Nathaniel Hawthorne</li>
        <li>"The Yellow Wallpaper" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman</li>
        <li>"Moby Dick" by Herman Melville</li>
        <li>"A Tale of Two Cities" by Charles Dickens</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Top titles are mostly from the English-language literary canon. Project Gutenberg focuses on older books whose U.S. copyrights have expired, which generally happens after 95 years. Other public-domain works are also collected. New books are added every day. In early July 2022, for example, books by Bear Bryant and George Kennan and a speech by Teddy Roosevelt were posted, among others. "The Great Gatsby" was added in 2021. Project Gutenberg has 2 of Kafka's works in English (many more in German). Still years to wait for "Catcher in the Rye."</p>
    <p>NotQuiteTher is grateful for the Project Gutenberg library. No affiliation between Project Gutenberg and NotQuiteTher.</p>
